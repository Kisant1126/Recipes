        <h1>Diet</h1>
        <p>We generally refer to “diet” as synonymous with a partial or almost total deprivation of food. However, the correct meaning of Diet is the set of <br>
            foods and dishes that are consumed each day, and constitutes the unit of nutrition.<br>
            Unlike the correct diet, correct nutrition refers to eating habits that meet the specific needs at different stages of life,<br>
             promotes adequate growth and development in boys and girls, and in adults allows maintaining or achieving the expected weight for height and prevents<br> 
             the development of diseases.</p>

             <p>
                <strong> Eat foods that contain all the nutrients the body needs to stay healthy. The body needs:</strong>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Proteins.</li>
                <li>Carbohydrates.</li>
                <li>Fats.</li>
                <li>Fiber.</li>
                <li>Vitamins and minerals.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Make sure you drink enough fluids. Most people should drink 8 (8-ounce) glasses of water a day. Ask your doctor or registered<br>
                 dietitian nutritionist if drinking more or less fluid is right for you.</p>
                <h3>Protein</h3>
