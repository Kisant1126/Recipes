        <h1>Diet</h1>
        <p>We generally refer to “diet” as synonymous with a partial or almost total deprivation of food. However, the correct meaning of Diet is the set of <br>
            foods and dishes that are consumed each day, and constitutes the unit of nutrition.<br>
            Unlike the correct diet, correct nutrition refers to eating habits that meet the specific needs at different stages of life,<br>
             promotes adequate growth and development in boys and girls, and in adults allows maintaining or achieving the expected weight for height and prevents<br> 
             the development of diseases.</p>
