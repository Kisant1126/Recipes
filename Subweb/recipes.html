                After that time we make six equal sized balls, work them with our hands and flatten them delicately.<br>
                Once ready, we cook them in a non-stick pan, with olive oil for about six minutes on each side at a medium-low temperature.<br>
                When the arepas are ready, we make a cut in one of the sides and fill it to taste with the mixture of ingredients: cheese, chicken and avocado mashed with a fork.</dd>

            </ul>
            <dd>Season the chicken pieces with salt and pepper and sauté them in a 40 cm diameter paella pan with a generous splash of extra virgin olive oil. <br>
                We only want them to take color on the outside, so, as soon as they brown slightly, we remove them from the paella and set aside. Peel the garlic <br>
                cloves and chop them finely. We add a little more oil to the paella if we see it necessary and sauté them over low heat. Before they brown, add the <br>
                two types of pepper, cleaned and cut into small cubes, season with salt and pepper and continue sautéing for a couple of minutes. We wash the tomato <br>
                 well, cut it in half and grate it. We add to the paella along with a tablespoon of chorizo pepper. We stir and sauté for a couple of minutes. Add the <br>
                  white wine and let the alcohol evaporate before adding the rice and sauté, stirring constantly, for another minute. Finally, we add the chicken to <br>
                  the paella along with three glasses of the chicken broth and increase the heat to maximum. We reserve the rest of the broth. We stir well to <br>
                  distribute the chicken throughout the container and, when the broth starts to boil, we count three minutes. We test the salt level and adjust it if <br> 
                  necessary. After this time, we lower the heat and cook the rice with chicken for 15 minutes without touching the rice, stirring, or anything similar. <br>
                   If the rice is dry of broth, we add the reserved one little by little, but it may not be necessary. After the cooking time has passed, remove the <br>
                   paella from the heat, cover with a clean cloth and let it rest for five minutes before serving. For the rice with chicken to come out perfect, it is <br>
                    important that the paella is of the indicated diameter and that the fire on which we cook it covers its entire base. If the fire is smaller than the <br>
                     paella, only the center will be cooked and the rice on the sides will be raw. In this case, if you use a smaller paella that fits your plate or <br>
                     burner, reduce the quantities of ingredients so that the rice is well spread over the base in a thin layer.</dd>

            <dd>We have two options for this recipe and in both of them we are going to ensure that the skin does not stick to the pan. On the one hand, cooking the<br> 
                sea bream open, which is the most practical way to secure the skin. In this case what we have to do is heat a little olive oil on the griddle, putting<br>
                 some baking paper in the pan. Season the sea bream with salt and pepper, place it on the meat side when the pan is hot over medium heat and cook for <br>
                 three minutes. We turn and cook for another three minutes. If what we have are clean sea bream fillets, the procedure changes slightly. Now we have to<br>
                  put a little olive oil in the pan, over high heat, and when it is very hot we reduce the heat to medium and put the sea bream with the skin part in <br>
                  the pan. We apply light pressure with our hand or put a weight so that the skin does not shrink and retract and we let it cook for three minutes. <br>
                  After this time, we turn off the heat, turn the sea bream over and cook it with the residual heat for a minute on the meat side.</dd>
